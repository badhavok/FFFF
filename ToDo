RTS/RPG element... Build "upgrade buildings" to unlock new towers/upgrades;  in turn, those are unlocked by earning specialist resources.  Winning levels gives upgrade options to increase base damage for "unlimited mode(s)"

Focus of game is to get your buildings setup ready to defeat the boss, you will need a mix of all towers, especially the boss tower upgrade to cause status effects to the boss

	- Gold generator, can be placed anywhere - Working

	Choice between one of the following?  Decides between branches?  Maximum of two?
		- Gas generator, limited placement? (Choice/changes depending on weather effect)
		- Liquid generator, limited placement?
		- Plasma generator, limited placement?
		- Mineral generator, limited placement?

	- Unlocks 3rd level towers, this upgrades to unlock the specialist towers : done & restricted to one build

	- Unlocks/upgrades individual status effects
City Base	- Unlocks player spells - maximum of 3?

	- Unlocks multi-tower?
	- Unlocks boss tower, increases rate of effect

Fix upgrade of "Buildings" (it fails to change to "done")

Add story/scenario modes that focus on certain elements; allowing each towers to be used + more "play time" - then add menus for each category  "Fire" / ...

Add unlimited mode

Add boss waves  :  Need to test further, should be working

Add "Mega" (final) bosses - instant lose

Add a "next wave now" option;  bonus gold?

Add other status changing towers

- fix cooldown for guns (already fixed for laser)  : test

- fix slow down enemy : done

- fix the DoT tic/countdown :  Is it needed?

- chain laser - diminishing effects;

- poison + 'splash' upgrade  :  done

- fear (runs backwards)  :  done

- doom; gives a countdown to death (high damage to make it certain or "Die()"?)

- curse (lowers Max hp (counters healers?)/defence (all?)) + virus (spreads)

- silence; stop enemy casting  -  Would be easier to create a casting class then an (if !silence)

- (not this game) add elements/weakness'/bonus damage  (lightening for stun, ice for slow etc..)
	(do these stay for 'time' or 'ever'?)

- (not this game) zombie (makes "heals" do damage"); won't work if enemy is undead already?

- chicken (?); changes appearance + removes defence/immunity

- "gravity" / hp% chance?  (I.E 25% of maxHP)  -  high cost upgrade

- increases debuff chances?  -  affects tower rate or enemy?

- "mini/toad/micro" tower for the 'mid range' enemies (to reduce to normal enemies'?)

- "All" (Exhaustion) tower : chance to cause all effects; not on boss

- "boss" tower; insanely expensive but allows status effecs to work on bosses (much lower rates to effect) & removes weakness/immunity from normal mobs?

- Priority settings?  :  Set "closest/furthest/flying/ground"

- money generator?  coal/water/wind/sun/fusion;
		Add random weather effects to slow/stop generation?
		Add time settings to switch game-play at night (PM) to use different generators?

Add 'advanced' flight path for random encounters?

Add player spells ?  To do what?

Add AoE visual effects

Add EnemyStats class  :  In progress/complete?

Add new models  :  in progress + animation is tested/working

Separate spell class for types?

Add other enemies

- flying only  :  done

- Transformer; periodically turns to a flying unit  : done
		Same/another which changes path?

- hide from towers : done

- levitate : done

- add a specific timer that spawns "Mid" enemies; regardless of how the player plays (I.E if they have sped up the spawns)  :  Maybe set this at "major" stages (5/10 etc..)

- specific boss wave  : done

- healing (done)  + max hp boost?

- grants stat/def bonus or immunity  -  in progress

- "golden" mobs; reduce value over time (maybe set a rand & update color based on +/- gold)  done
	Make these so you tap the screen - done
	Make an "announcement" -

- speed(done)/defense(done)/stat boost

- add formula to increase stats based on level/wave
	[base + (base / 2) + (wave * 5)]
	hp = 100 + (100 / 2) + (1 * 5) = 155
	hp = 100 + (100 / 2) + (10 * 5) = 200
	hp = 1000 + (1000 / 2) + (1 * 5) = 1505
	hp = 1000 + (1000 / 2) + (10 * 5) = 1555

	[base + ((wave / 2) + base)];
	def/element =  0 + ((1 / 2) + 0) = .5
	def/element =  0 + ((10 / 2) + 0) = 5
	def/element =  0 + ((100 / 2) + 0) = 50
	def/element =  10 + ((1 / 2) + 10) = 20.5
	def/element =  10 + ((5 / 2) + 10) = 22.5
	def/element =  10 + ((10 / 2) + 10) = 25
	def/element =  10 + ((100 / 2) + 10) = 75

- immunity

- default immunity to #

	- decoy/provoke
		Makes towers in range focus on mob
(same as each other)
	- duplicate chance?
		Earlier mobs stop for # while duplicating and quickens through the stages
			(these do not move/make towers focus attention?)

- necromancer/summoner/"spawner"  :  done
		summons various mobs (maybe new/different ones?) slightly ahead of itself; later versions summon more and keep moving(?)

- vampire
		steals HP from nearby mobs? (for bosses that summon - create an AoE requirement)

Add enemy defenses/weakness' - in progress


Long term goals :

Achievments : Add hidden easter eggs/trophies; "I'm a hacker" (find secret menu via GameGuardian/other)

https://www.fortressofdoors.com/optimizing-tower-defense-for-focus-and-thinking-defenders-quest/

Hide health bar when unit is full health

Click on enemy to show stats

Make a random spawner that allows for an infinite wave, selecting from a pool of each enemy type per wave

Procedurally generate environments

Planetary Outpost UA-1  -  Add new "People" tower; enemies won't stop but these will have ~3-5 mini actions to assist with various status effects

- effectively the same as the normal towers
