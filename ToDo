RTS/RPG element... Build "upgrade buildings" to unlock new towers/upgrades;  in turn, those are unlocked by earning specialist resources.  Winning levels gives upgrade options to increase base damage for "unlimited mode(s)"

Focus of game is to get your buildings setup ready to defeat the boss, you will need a mix of all towers, especially the boss tower upgrade to cause status effects to the boss

	- Gold generator, can be placed anywhere - Working

	Choice between two of the following?
	- Decides between branches?
	- Add a counter to the buildmanager which just adds when one of the upgrades are built; to a maximum of 2
	...Depends on the level that you're playing?

		- Gas generator, limited placement? (Choice/changes depending on weather effect)
		- Liquid generator, limited placement?
		- Plasma generator, limited placement?
		- Mineral generator, limited placement?

	- Unlocks 3rd level towers, this upgrades to unlock the specialist towers : done & restricted to one build

	- Unlocks/upgrades individual status effects
City Base	- Unlocks player spells - maximum of 3?

	- Unlocks multi-tower?
	- Unlocks boss tower, increases rate of effect

Fix upgrade of "Buildings" (it fails to change to "done")  :  done

Add fire focus to towers - not sure if I'll let the player choose this per tower or if they will be set standard by me;  maybe add flying enemy focus, magic/phys def/'other'

Add upgrade system for the player with level winnings

Add upgrade menus with the level winnings

Add "capture system" that is an extra currency which allows for "special upgrades"?  Need to decide if these will be 'bonus' drops that needs the player to click the screen
	-  I.E certain creatures (bosses?) will be capture-able in order to upgrade certain specialist upgrades;
	 		-  I.E.E bosses on level 1 will "drop" this item, so in theory a few replay levels to get you ready for level2?
			-  You need 10 items to upgrade; possible 1 drops from mid bosses, 2 from end bosses?
					- between 10-20 waves per level (starting at 10 and increasing?); E.G 5 chances per level = 50>100
						- increasing drops required when getting to level 10?

Add story/scenario modes that focus on certain elements; allowing each towers to be used + more "play time" - then add menus for each category "Fire" / ...

Add unlimited mode

Add boss waves  :  Done

Need to test what is "fun" to play when using spells against a boss - Should there be a flat 1x [dmg] for all the spells since they aren't that effective on the boss; there may/will be a Boss tower which could be the final upgrade for any of the towers (specialist per branch?) or a mega tower like below -

Add "Mega" (final) bosses - instant lose? OR 3 star system for upgrades?

Add a "next wave now" option;  bonus gold = time*10?

Add speed up/slow down function  :  done

Add other status changing towers

- fix cooldown for guns (already fixed for laser)  : test

- fix slow down enemy : done

- fix the DoT tic/countdown :  Is it needed?

- chain laser - diminishing effects;  "bounce/stream" to another enemy & weakens each time?

- poison + 'splash' upgrade  :  done

- fear (runs backwards)  :  done

- doom; gives a countdown to death (high damage to make it certain or "Die()"?)  :  done

- curse (lowers Max hp (counters healers?)/defence (all?)) + virus (spreads)  :  done

- silence; stop enemy casting  :  DONE

- (not this version/game?) add elements/weakness'/bonus damage  (lightening for stun, ice for slow etc..)
	(do these stay for 'time' or 'ever'?)

- (not this game) zombie (makes "heals" do damage"); won't work if enemy is undead already?

- chicken;  done, need correct gameobject

- "gravity" / hp% chance?  (I.E 25% of maxHP)  -  high cost upgrade  :  Done

- increases debuff chances?  -  affects tower rate or enemy?

- ignore defenses  :  Done

- "All" ("Exhaustion" on a timer?) tower : chance to cause all effects; on boss/lower hit rate?

- "Final upgrade" tower per branch?

- (separate) "boss" tower; insanely expensive but allows status effects to work on bosses? (much lower rates to effect) & removes weakness/immunity from normal mobs/ignores defense/does gravity damage (less effective on normal mobs but effective against bosses)

- Priority settings?  :  Set "closest/furthest" ; in progress

- money generator?  coal/water/wind/sun/fusion;
		Add random weather effects to slow/stop generation?
		Add regional/time settings to switch game-play at night (PM) to use different generators?

Add 'advanced' flight path for random encounters?
	- This would mean that the player should place certain towers in certain places - would it be too frustrating to find out after you lose a level?  Should I make it known there is a 'flight-path'?

Add player spells ?  ;  In progress - need to think how I can implement the system so that a player can only choose certain spells(Is it needed?)
                  -  do I make them cost one of the upgrade tower costs?  Trying to add more gameplay mechanics...
		This is what is currently implemented
		-  Maybe I could add a cooldown per spell; and the upgraded towers make the cooldown reduced by a certain % ?
											- Cooldown is depending on how effective/powerful the skill is

Add visual effects  : in progress

Add EnemyStats class  :  In progress

Add new models  :  in progress + animation MUST be tested/working

Separate spell class :  done

Add other enemies

- flying only  :  done

- Hovercraft/Transformer; periodically turns to a flying unit  : done
		Same/another which changes path?

- hide from towers : done

- levitate : done

- Not sure if I 'want' to do this
- add a specific timer that spawns "Mid" enemies; regardless of how the player plays (I.E if they have sped up the spawns)  :  Maybe set this at "major" stages (5/10 etc..) : This has been setup as a spell, maybe add it as a hidden effect on certain stages

- specific boss wave  : done

- healing : done

- max hp boost ;  Is this really needed?

- grants stat/def bonus  ;  Is this any different to healing/immunity?

- "golden" mobs; increase value over time - done
	Make these so you tap the screen - done
	Make an "announcement" - Needs doing

- speed(done)/defense(done)

- add formula to increase stats based on level/wave
	[base + (base / 2) + (level * 5) + (wave * 5)]
	hp = 100 + (100 / 2) + (1 * 5) + (1 * 5) =
	hp = 100 + (100 / 2) + (1 * 5) + (10 * 5) =
	hp = 100 + (100 / 2) + (1 * 5) + (100 * 5) = 655

	hp = 1000 + (1000 / 2) + (1 * 10) = 1510
	hp = 1000 + (1000 / 2) + (5 * 10) = 1550
	hp = 1000 + (1000 / 2) + (10 * 10) = 1555
	hp = 1000 + (1000 / 2) + (100 * 10) = 2000

	[base + ((wave / 2) + base)];
	def/element =  0 + ((1 / 2) + 0) = .5
	def/element =  0 + ((10 / 2) + 0) = 5
	def/element =  0 + ((100 / 2) + 0) = 50

	def/element =  10 + ((1 / 2) + 10) = 20.5
	def/element =  10 + ((5 / 2) + 10) = 22.5
	def/element =  10 + ((10 / 2) + 10) = 25
	def/element =  10 + ((100 / 2) + 10) = 75

basic principles;
 		defence just replaces the need for more HP but it allows for units to be healed and survive longer on the path;  I.E  add healers around high defence units

		Set certain levels that will be unique to some of the upgrades on certain towers - set prefabs for elemental/defences (try to make them relatable to the "class/race?")

		- base mobs x3 = standard stats
		- magic users = high mag def, lower hp
		- armoured = high phys def, small hp boost
		- mini boss = medium hp, specialist stats designed for the level
		- full boss = high hp, specialist stats designed for the level

- Add races / weaknesses for those races; ships/armoured & aliens/carbon etc...
AND/OR
- Add class weaknesses?  (healers etc..)

- immunity  :  done

- default immunity to #  ;  basically "50000 def"

- decoy/provoke (except for AoE ofc) OR setup options for player OR always focus on the furthest (closest to finish) enemy along the path?
	Makes towers in range focus on mob
		(same as each other)

- duplicate chance?  :  done
	Mobs stop for (spawnamount * 1f + 0.5f) while duplicating so it can be animated/flows with gameplay :  done

- necromancer/summoner/"spawner"  :  done
		Add a function that stops the enemy while it's "duplicating"  :  should be done
		Give a special effect

- vampire  :  done
		steals HP from nearby mobs? (for bosses that summon - create an AoE requirement)

Add enemy defenses/weakness' - in progress

Update the touch input to input.mousePosition to reduce code and make sure only one touch is detected  :  Done

Long term goals :

Fix Summon/duplicate to add to "Current spawn count" : check this is working correctly

Achievements : Add hidden easter eggs/trophies; "I'm a hacker menu" (find secret menu via GameGuardian/other)

https://www.fortressofdoors.com/optimizing-tower-defense-for-focus-and-thinking-defenders-quest/

Hide health bar when unit is full health  :  done

Make a random spawner that allows for an infinite wave, selecting from a pool of each enemy type per wave

Procedurally generate environments

Planetary Outpost UA-1  -  Add new "People" tower; enemies won't stop but these will have ~3-5 mini actions to assist with various status effects

- effectively the same as the normal towers / units
